Now that we've created the core components for the login, dashboard, and programs management pages, here's how to set up and run the project:

Create your project structure:
mkdir health-info-system
cd health-info-system

Set up the backend:
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors dotenv

Set up the frontend:
cd ..
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm install axios react-router-dom

Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the server directory with your MongoDB connection string:
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/health-info-system
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development

Start the backend server:
cd server
node server.js

Start the React frontend:
cd client
npm start


Next Steps
To complete the health information system according to your requirements, you should implement:

Client Registration: Create a form to register new clients
Client Search/List: Implement a search feature to find existing clients
Client Profile: Design a view for displaying client details and programs
Program Enrollment: Create a functionality to enroll clients in programs
API Endpoints for External Access: Implement the public API for exposing client profiles

The code structure we've created provides a solid foundation for these features. You can follow the same patterns established in the programs management functionality to implement the remaining client-related features.
Would you like me to continue by implementing any of these remaining features?

Database Design (MongoDB)
Let's create three main collections:

Users (doctors/staff)
Clients (patients)
Programs (health programs)

Suggested Pages
Frontend (React)

Login/Authentication Page
Dashboard - Overview with stats and quick actions
Programs Management - Create, view, edit programs
Client Registration - Form to add new clients
Client Search/List - Search and display clients
Client Profile - View client details and enrolled programs
Program Enrollment - Assign programs to clients

API Endpoints

Authentication

POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout


Programs

GET /api/programs
POST /api/programs
GET /api/programs/
PUT /api/programs/
DELETE /api/programs/


Clients

GET /api/clients
POST /api/clients
GET /api/clients/
PUT /api/clients/
DELETE /api/clients/
GET /api/clients/search?query=...


Enrollments

POST /api/clients//programs
DELETE /api/clients//programs/


Public API

GET /api/public/clients/ - Exposed client profile for external systems



Would you like me to create the basic code structure for any specific part of this system? I can start with either the MongoDB schemas, the backend API routes, or the React frontend components.
